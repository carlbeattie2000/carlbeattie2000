Hi, I'm Carl! I'm a 22-year-old software engineer from London who is passionate about learning and building new things. While I may not have professional experience in the tech industry, I have spent a lot of time learning about software engineering and am always eager to continue learning and improving my skills. I have experience with JavaScript and Node.js, and am excited to continue growing and contributing to the tech community through my work on GitHub. In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies and projects, or spending time with friends and family. If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me at 12beattiecastp@gmail.com.
